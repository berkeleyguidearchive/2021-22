This course introduces engineering students to the analysis and design of load-bearing components of flight structures, ranging from subsonic aircraft to rockets. Emphasis is placed on the quasi-static and dynamic analysis of structural components which are prevalent in aerospace engineering. Attention is also devoted to a comprehensive design roadmap of flight vehicle structures from the full system- to the individual component-level</span><br/>
