				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Berkeley offers an interdisciplinary undergraduate program leading to a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Film &amp; Media. The program offers rigorous engagement with the entire culture of moving-images, teaching students to think historically, theoretically, and analytically about a wide range of cinematic forms. At the same time, it encourages students to look at moving images from the vantage point of other disciplines. To this end, the Department of Film &amp; Media cooperates with a number of other departments and programs on campus. Students earning their BA in Film &amp; Media may also choose to complement their study of the history and theory of moving images with the hands-on experience provided by production and screenwriting classes.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>To declare a major in Film &amp; Media, students must have completed a minimum of 30 units, and have satisfactorily completed <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=FILM%2010" title="FILM 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'FILM 10');">FILM 10</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=FILM%2020" title="FILM 20" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'FILM 20');">FILM 20</a></span>. For further information regarding prerequisites, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To be eligible for admission to the honors program in Film &amp; Media, a student must have attained senior standing with a grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 or higher on all University work and a 3.5 GPA or higher in courses in the major.  Students in the honors program are to take <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=FILM%20H195" title="FILM H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'FILM H195');">FILM H195</a></span> for a letter grade to complete a senior honors thesis. Although the production of a film may be part of the preparation of the thesis — and the film may be submitted as a documentation, or example — it is expected that the thesis will be a substantial piece of writing on film and media theory, criticism, or history.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Film &amp; Media.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://filmmedia.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p><strong>*Beginning Fall 2020, the Film &amp; Media program will be rolling out a new curriculum. The new curriculum expands the department's production-based course offerings, gives more consideration to emerging and alternative media, expands the scope of required courses into related media fields, and provides more flexibility in pathways through the major. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The major structural changes include removing the foreign language requirement and replacing it with an elective requirement that creates a total of five elective requirements instead of the previous four.</strong></p>
<p><strong>While many courses under the new curriculum have been adapted from existing courses, the course numbering system has been completely revamped as well, making course numbering more rational and predictable (such as numbering all electives in the 170 series and all production courses in the 180 series).</strong></p>
<p><strong>All the following requirements and policies are based on this new curriculum. </strong></p>
<p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the requirements below specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, with the exception of one upper-division elective, which can be taken on a P/NP grading basis. There are a few other exceptions; see Major Advisor for details.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, with the exception of minors offered outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained across all upper- and lower-division courses used to fulfill the major requirements. In addition, each specific upper- and lower-division course used to fulfill major requirements needs to be passed with a C- or better.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>After completing the Film &amp; Media major, a student will have a working knowledge of the film-making process from concept to exhibition and will be able to interpret films through a variety of aesthetic, cultural, historical, and theoretical frameworks. The critical thinking skills promoted in the film major involve seeing beyond one’s immediate reactions to a film by developing a repertoire of productive interpretive questions and approaches that lead to more complex understanding and appreciation of the filmic experience. Analytic reasoning is encouraged in both oral and written assignments that require students to perform systematic analysis of film sequences, to construct careful, step-by-step arguments in larger research projects, or to create a coherently constructed film or script. Communication skills are developed through participation in classroom discussions, in the effective writing of critical essays and research papers, and in the articulation of creative ideas through film-making and scriptwriting.</p>
<p>More specifically, the successful graduate from the Film &amp; Media major must be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li><!--class="Mso"--><!--class="Mso"--><span lang="EN">produce formal and aesthetic analyses of different media forms drawing on both medium-specific and comparative approaches;</span></li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">think beyond the surface impressions of popular film and media texts by developing a repertoire of critical questions and approaches that facilitate deeper understanding, including concepts of concepts of race, ethnicity, nation, empire, colonialism, class, gender, and sexual orientation;</span></li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">engage in the critical study of film and media in an expanded framework, focusing on experimental (social and political), documentary, and global perspectives as part of a comparative approach to a range of media forms including film, television, new media, sound, photography, and more;</span></li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">learn basic principles of film analysis through the early emergence of film form;</span></li>

This course is intended to introduce undergraduates to the study of a range of media, including photography, film, television, video, and print and digital media. The course will focus on questions of medium &quot;specificity&quot; or the key technological/material, formal and aesthetic features of different media and modes of address and representation that define them.

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course explores the international development of artist made, experimental and avant-garde film, electronic or new media practices. It looks at the ways artists have invented new formal languages in order to express their unique ideas and vision, and also how they have created alternative modes of production, distribution, and exhibition for their work. The course examines major movements in experimental and alternative media that exist outside of the constraints of industrial and mass media forms, as it at once critiques and expands dominant forms of media.<br/>To broaden student awareness &amp; understanding of the history of experimental &amp; alternative film &amp; media practices that exist outside of the dominant film industry, including fine art practices that have emerged from the visual &amp; sonic arts rather than the dominant literary &amp; dramatic forms. To study underground &amp; marginal communities that have been under or unrepresented by the dominant film &amp; media industries. The course will also look beyond the artwork itself to explore the kinds of creative sub-cultures communities that this approach to art making has produced.<br/>
While emphasis on medium and technology may vary from year to year, depending on the instructor, conceptually, the course will always focus on film and media art as a form of personal and creative expression with a philosophical position that emphasizes process and invention over product and professional mastery.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Acquire a conceptual and aesthetic vocabulary necessary for the recognition and interpretation of experimental and alternative media practices in different media forms and technologies and to understand why experimental approaches to media practices have influenced, the dominant film and media world, the art world and academic film and media studies.<br/>
Acquire new informational content about the national/regional/global media landscape in question; with an emphasis on the role experimental film and media products play in the evolution of film and media language and form.<br/>
Develop the analytic skills necessary to interpret in a socio-historical and aesthetic context the art and media objects belonging to that area and learn about the cultural contexts in which those media practices are located.<br/>
