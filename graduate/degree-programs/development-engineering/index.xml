<h4><strong>Designated Emphasis in Development Engineering</strong></h4>
<p>Through coursework, research mentoring, and professional development, the Designated Emphasis in Development Engineering (DE in DevEng) prepares students to develop, pilot, and evaluate technological interventions designed to improve human and economic development within complex, low-resource settings. </p>
<p>The DE in DevEng is an interdisciplinary training program for UC Berkeley doctoral students from any department whose dissertation research includes topics related to the application of technology to address the needs of people living in poverty. Students from all departments can <a href="https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/deveng/apply">apply</a>. </p>
<p>With initial support from <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/GlobalDevLab">USAID’s Global Development Lab</a>, the program builds upon ongoing research in technological innovations, human-centered design, development economics, remote sensing and monitoring, data science, and impact analysis at UC Berkeley. The program also features a National Science Foundation Traineeship for Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems, <a href="https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/infews/">InFEWS</a>.</p>
<p>DevEng students are connected to an ecosystem of researchers and practitioners at Berkeley via the <a href="https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/development-engineering/">Graduate Group in Development Engineering</a>, and also have access to a dynamic global network.</p>
<p>What is a Designated Emphasis? A “Designated Emphasis” (DE) is a campus-wide system that provides doctoral students with certification in specialties outside their home discipline, to be added to their doctorates.</p>
