<h2>About the Program</h2>
<p>The UC Berkeley School of Law offers a broad, three-year curriculum leading to the Juris Doctor (JD) degree. Berkeley Law educates students not only for the practice of law but also for all the varied roles lawyers perform in modern society. The law school provides an intellectually challenging course of study that imparts the theoretical and practical skills necessary for effective, creative, and responsible legal counseling and advocacy. To this end, Berkeley Law's curriculum is continually evolving and offers hundreds of courses, including dozens in its top-ranked Intellectual Property, International Law, Social Justice, and Environmental Law programs.</p>
<p>The school is a member of the Association of American Law Schools and is accredited by the American Bar Association. Its graduates are qualified to become applicants for admission to practice in any state of the United States.</p>
<p>Berkeley Law does not require or even recommend a specific pre-law major. To prepare for law school, students should take courses that help them develop written and oral communication skills; increase analytical and problem-solving skills; obtain broad exposure to the humanities and social sciences in order to understand the social context within which legal problems arise; and acquire a general understanding of economics, because many legal problems relate to the economic functioning of society.</p>
<p>In selecting specific courses, consultation with an undergraduate advisor may be desirable. Berkeley Law seeks a student body with a broad set of interests, backgrounds, life experiences, and perspectives.</p>
<p>The school also offers programs, mainly for foreign-educated attorneys, that lead to the degree of Master of Laws (LLM) or the degree of Doctor of the Science of Law (JSD).</p>

</ul>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Any additional coursework must be approved by the student’s faculty adviser and the J.S.D. Program Faculty Director.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">With prior approval from the J.S.D. Program Faculty Director, a student may be permitted to enroll in fewer than 12 units of independent study in a given semester in order to allow them to take a teaching pedagogy course in addition to one other course.</p>
<h4><span>3. Submission of Fall and Spring Semester Progress Report and Course Approval forms:</span></h4>
<p>During every semester of the J.S.D. program (including the first year), a student must complete and submit a “Progress Report and Course Approval” form to the ADP Office by the CalCentral Add/Drop deadline in Fall and Spring semesters. Each semester’s form must  detail:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The progress the student has made toward the goals set out in his/her last report (explaining deviations from these goals, if any)</li>
	<li>Goals for the upcoming term, including a timetable for completion of those goals</li>
	<li>Course enrollment for the semester.</li>
</ol>
<p>The form must be signed by the student’s faculty adviser. It must also be signed by the J.S.D. Faculty Director to approve any coursework beyond independent study. Timely submission of Progress Report and Course Approval forms is required to maintain a student’s good standing in the J.S.D. program. Late submission puts a student’s status at risk.</p>
<h4>4. Formation of Committees:</h4>
<p>By the Spring semester of the first year, in consultation with the student’s faculty adviser, the student must identify 4 faculty members to serve on their Qualifying Exam (QE) committee and 3 faculty members to serve on their dissertation committee. Each committee must have a Chair, an Academic Senate Representative (ASR), and one or more additional member(s). The chair of the dissertation committee must be the student’s primary faculty adviser; the chair of the oral exam committee must be a faculty member from the law school other than the student’s primary adviser. All committee members must be members of the UC Berkeley Academic Senate (i.e., tenured or tenure-track faculty) unless an exception is granted by the Graduate Division.</p>
<h4>5. Qualifying Examination:</h4>
<p>The Qualifying Examination for J.S.D. candidacy should take place in the Spring semester or summer of the first year (and no later than Fall semester of the second year). The focus of the examination will be on the student’s proposed dissertation project. Successful passage of the QE is required before advancement to candidacy. At least three weeks before the QE is to take place, students must apply to take the exam by submitting the Higher Degree Committees/Qualifying Exam eForm in CalCentral. It is the <span>student’s responsibility to arrange a date and time for the exam that works for all committee </span><span>members.</span></p>
<h4>6. Submission of Abstract/Prospectus:</h4>
<p>Two weeks prior to taking the QE, the student must submit to the QE committee a substantial piece of writing outlining a proposed dissertation project, in either of the following forms:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A short abstract (one page), plus a table-of-contents-like outline of the dissertation as a whole, plus one chapter of minimum 20 pages, <strong>OR</strong></li>
	<li>A minimum 20-page prospectus of the dissertation, providing a detailed discussion of the questions to be addressed, relevant literature and arguments surrounding the topic, and proposed research strategy for addressing the topic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Where the student plans to write multiple shorter papers instead of a single long paper, he or<br/>
she should submit either:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A 20-page draft of one of the papers plus short paragraph abstracts of the other two; or</li>
	<li>Multiple shorter prospectus-like summaries of each paper, of a minimum of six pages each.</li>
</ol>
<h4>7. Application for Candidacy:</h4>
<p>A student will be eligible for J.S.D. candidacy once the student has passed the oral examination and successfully completed all required coursework. The student must submit the Higher Degree Committees/Advancement to Candidacy eForm by the end of the semester in which the student completes candidacy requirements. If a student will be working with human subjects or animals, then the student must also complete training in human subjects research by taking and passing the online CITI Program, a basic course in the Protection of Human Research Subjects. Before beginning research, students must obtain approval for their research protocol from the Committee for Protection of Human Subjects.</p>
<h4>8. Continuous Enrollment:</h4>
<p>Once advanced to candidacy, students must maintain their student registration by enrolling in 12 units of independent study per semester for the duration of the program. Upon advancing to candidacy, a J.S.D. candidate must focus primarily on the research and writing of the dissertation.</p>
<h4>9. Duration of Program</h4>
<p>All program requirements including coursework and the dissertation are to be completed within three years. Extensions of time will be considered on a case-by-case basis; if granted, students must enroll only in independent study and may not take additional coursework. Extensions of time will not include an extension of the nonresident tuition waiver (if applicable) or any financial support from the law school, if previously awarded. After five years, candidacy will lapse and may not be reinstated except in extremely extenuating circumstances.</p>
<h4>10. Filing of Dissertation</h4>
<p>An electronic copy of the dissertation must be filed with the Graduate Division no later than the last day of the semester in which the student intends to graduate. A copy of the Receipt of Filing must be submitted to the Registrar’s Office within one week of filing. The dissertation must consist of original work in the form of a monograph or three shorter papers suitable for publication, and constitute a substantial contribution to learning in the field of research. Publishable papers and article-length essays are acceptable only if incorporated into a larger argument that binds together the dissertation as a whole. Inclusion of a student’s already-published work in the dissertation requires advance approval by the Graduate Division (for details, see <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/academic progress/dissertation/">http://grad.berkeley.edu/academic progress/dissertation/</a>). All student dissertations will be archived at the University Library.</p>
