<p class="text-intro">The UC Berkeley–UCSF Joint Medical Program (JMP) attracts people who are passionately dedicated to improving the world’s health through scholarly self-directed yet collaborative inquiry. This is reflected in both the <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/programs/graduate/joint/joint-medical-program/curriculum/">medical curriculum</a> and <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/programs/graduate/joint/joint-medical-program/curriculum/masters-degree/">master’s program</a>.</p>
<p class="text-intro">The masters program provides a broad trans-disciplinary exploration of the social determinants of health, health systems science, population health, health equity, and data science. Students  have access to a large range of research topics which is part of what makes the JMP MS unique. Concurrently, students participate in an innovative student-led, faculty supported Foundational Sciences curriculum through <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/programs/graduate/joint/joint-medical-program/curriculum/problem-based-learning/">Problem-Based Learning</a> (PBL).</p>
<p class="text-intro">As part of the UC Berkeley campus community, our 16 students per cohort are supported by a multidisciplinary, close-knit, and inter-professional team of faculty and staff, committed to individualized support for students’ success.</p>

<h3 class="Normal1">JMP Masters of Health &amp; Medical Sciences Thesis</h3>
<p class="Normal1">A JMP student’s MS coursework and research culminate in the crafting of a thesis, including an in-depth literature review of the student’s area of expertise and a scholarly product, often a manuscript for submission to a journal. Students can pursue research in any field of knowledge with a link to human health.  A database of prior JMP research theses can be accessed at: <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/ucb_ucsf_joint_medical_program" target="_blank">http://escholarship.org/uc/ucb_ucsf_joint_medical_program</a></p>

The focus of this course is on medical physiology—the study of the human body's normal functioning. Physiology underpins the rest of the foundational medical sciences curriculum by allowing students to map and anchor the additional learning necessary to make sense of complex problem-based learning (PBL) medical cases later in the curriculum. Students will learn physiology through team-based learning (TBL), a student-centered pedagogy in which they</span><span class="deschide"> work with physiological problems to solve them collaboratively. By actively engaging in learning through problem-solving, students do more than memorize content; they learn how to work together to build a strong web of interconnected information to solve real-world problems.</span><br/>

Beginning in this semester, you will learn all the foundational medical sciences through problem-based learning (PBL), which builds upon the foundation of physiological knowledge learned through TBL in your first semester. PBL is an evidence-based educational strategy underpinned by a constructivist philosophy of learning. The foundational medical sciences include, among others, pathology, pharmacology, biochemistry, immunology, microbiology</span><span class="deschide">, genetics, behavioral sciences, epidemiology, public health, medical sociology, and other social sciences.</span><br/>

This course's goal is to provide a method for medical students to think, write about, and discuss feelings engendered by clinical encounters. Medical students are taught the need to be emotionally detached from patients, yet being emotionally detached does not mean devoid of emotion.
