<p class="Normal1">The Graduate Group in Science and Mathematics Education (known informally as SESAME) offers an interdisciplinary graduate program leading to a doctoral degree in science, mathematics, technology, and engineering education. The program is designed to give graduates advanced expertise in a STEM discipline as well as in educational theory and research methodologies.</p>
<p class="Normal1">This Graduate Group was established so individuals with training or experience in a mathematical, scientific, or technical discipline can pursue advanced studies focused on educational issues in these disciplines. SESAME produces scholars who can communicate effectively with scientists, mathematicians, and engineers as well as with educational researchers and practitioners. <span style="font-size:1em">SESAME students are expected to attain a level of expertise equivalent to that of a Master's student in their chosen discipline.</span></p>
<p class="Normal1"><span style="font-size:1em">Thesis work typically consists of basic research on learning or cognition in a STEM field or the development of improved pedagogical approaches based on relevant models and research. Upon satisfactory completion of their studies and thesis work, students will obtain the degree of Ph.D. in Science and Mathematics Education.</span></p>
<p class="Normal1">SESAME also offers a <a href="https://sesame.berkeley.edu/learning-sciences-certificate-program">Learning Sciences Certificate in Instructional Design, Learning Technologies, and Education Research</a>.</p>

<h3 class="Normal1">Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant has completed a basic degree from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 on a 9-point scale (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without the need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. <em>If the applicant is admitted,</em> then <em>official </em>transcripts of all college-level work will be required. Official transcripts must be in sealed envelopes as issued by the school(s) attended. If you have attended Berkeley, upload your unofficial transcript with your application for the departmental initial review. <em>If you are admitted,</em> an official transcript with evidence of degree conferral <em>will not</em> be required.</li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, not the Graduate Division.</li> 	<li> 	<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">Evidence of English language proficiency:</span> </strong>All applicants who have completed a basic degree from a country or political entity in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to institutions from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement:</p> 	<ul> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses in English as a Second Language,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses conducted in a language other than English,</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</span></p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">courses of a non-academic nature.</span></p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:30pt"><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7a006b7d-7fff-5bf6-e871-4a34569dad42">If applicants have previously been denied admission to Berkeley on the basis of their English language proficiency, they must submit new test scores that meet the current minimum from one of the standardized tests. Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS). The institution code for Berkeley is 4833. Official IELTS score reports must be sent electronically from the testing center to University of California, Berkeley, Graduate Division, Sproul Hall, Rm 318 MC 5900, Berkeley, CA 94720. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years.</span></span></p> <div> </div> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a>. </p>
<h3 class="Normal1">Admission to the Program</h3>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Requirements</h4>
<ol>
	<li class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">A bachelor’s degree or its recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li>
	<li class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Superior scholastic record, normally well above a 3.0 GPA;</li>
	<li class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Indication of appropriate research goals, described in the statement of purpose;</li>
	<li class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Results of the General Test of the Graduate Record Exam (GRE); and</li>
	<li class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">For international applicants whose academic work has been in a language other than English, the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Selection Criteria</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">SESAME accepts three to six PhD students each year from more than 50 applications. Applicants are judged on a number of factors; good scores and a high GPA are necessary but not sufficient. Particularly valued are potential as a researcher and educator, a strong background in a STEM discipline, and an agenda that fits well with the work of specific faculty in this small, interdisciplinary program. Applicants should clearly indicate in their statement of purpose which faculty member(s) they are interested in doing research with and why.</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Experience teaching, developing instructional materials, or doing educational or psychological research in these areas will also be favorably considered.  Knowledge of psychology, cognitive science, education, or statistics is helpful but not required. See <a href="https://gse.berkeley.edu/academics/additional-degree-programs/graduate-group-science-and-mathematics-education-sesame/sesame">SESAME Admissions</a> for more information. SESAME accepts applications for only the Fall semester.</p>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Statement of Purpose and Personal History</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">The statement of purpose and personal history are two separate essays.</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">The statement of purpose should succinctly explain your reasons for applying to SESAME, briefly review our relevant academic preparation and work experience, and describe your future academic or professional goals once the degree is acquired. The focus should be on your preparation, experience, and aims rather than a discussion of the trends or importance of education in general. The most successful statements are one to two pages in length and focus on the strengths and experiences of the applicant, providing the reviewers with evidence and justification for admitting those applicants who are qualified and well-suited for SESAME.</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">The personal history should include any relevant information not already included in the statement of purpose. Additional suggestions may be found in the Graduate Division’s Personal Statement Guide. There is no minimum length for the personal history.</p>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">These two essays are used in part to evaluate the candidate’s writing skills. Pursuant to UC Berkeley Policy, the two statements must be written by the candidate.</p>
<h4 class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Three Letters of Recommendation</h4>
<p class="Normal1CxSpMiddle">Ph.D. applicants should provide at least three and no more than five letters that speak directly to their ability and potential to perform academic work at the doctoral level.</p>

<h4 class="Normal1">Preliminary Examination</h4>
<p>The preliminary exam occurs in Spring semester of the first year. The exam is based upon the first year's coursework, and is more than a review of the readings. Students are expected to be able to analyze and synthesize what they have read, and to take a position on the main issues in cognitive and educational research. The exam consists of a written essay component followed by a one-hour oral conversation based upon the written essays. The exam is intended to provide not a barrier but a snapshot, for the student's year-end evaluation, of growth and enculturation into the intellectual community.</p>
