<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The JMP is a five-year graduate/medical degree program. The pre-clerkship years are spent at UC Berkeley, engaging in a leading-edge integrated Problem-Based Learning medical curriculum while simultaneously earning a master’s degree (MS) in the Health and Medical Sciences at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health. After two and a half years, our students move across the bay to UCSF to finish their medical education and receive their medical doctorate (MD).</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Program</h3>
<p>There is no undergraduate program in Health and Medical Sciences. However, <a href="/2021-22/undergraduate/degree-programs/premed/">Pre-Med/Pre-Health</a> is a pre-professional path that students choose when preparing for a career in graduate-level health professions. </p>
