<h3>Overview</h3>

<div class="field-item odd">
<p>The School of Information is UC Berkeley’s newest professional school. Located in the center of campus, the I School is a graduate research and education community committed to expanding access to information and to improving its usability, reliability, and credibility while preserving security and privacy. This requires the insights of scholars from diverse fields — information and computer science, design, social sciences, management, law, and policy.</p>
<p>Based in UC Berkeley’s historic South Hall, roughly <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people?role=124" target="_blank">125 on-campus graduate students, 500+ online graduate students</a>, and <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/faculty" target="_blank">27 faculty members</a> form a small, multi-disciplinary collective of scholars and practitioners.</p>
<p>The I School offers three professional master’s degrees and an academic doctoral degree. The <a href="/2021-22/graduate/degree-programs/information-management-systems/" target="_blank">MIMS program</a> trains students for careers as information professionals and emphasizes small classes and project-based learning. The <a href="/2021-22/graduate/degree-programs/information-data-science/" target="_blank">MIDS program</a> trains data scientists to manage and analyze the coming onslaught of big data, in a unique high-touch online degree. The <a href="/2021-22/graduate/degree-programs/information-cybersecurity/" target="_blank">MICS program</a> trains students for careers in cybersecurity by providing them with skills and contextual knowledge to assume leadership positions in private sector technology companies as well as government and military organizations. The <a href="/2021-22/graduate/degree-programs/information-management-systems-phd/" target="_blank">PhD program</a> equips scholars to develop solutions and shape policies that influence how people seek, use, and share information.</p>

<h3>History</h3>




<p>The UC Berkeley School of Information was created in 1994 to address one of society’s most compelling challenges: enabling people to create, find, manipulate, share, store, and use information in myriad forms.</p>




<p>Originally known as the School of Information Management and Systems (SIMS), this research-and-learning enterprise became the School of Information in 2006. The I School traces its roots to the 1920s, when UC Berkeley founded its School of Librarianship, ensuring universal access to information and educating &quot;knowledge&quot; professionals well before the age of the Internet. In 1976 the School of Librarianship became the School of Library and Information Studies. </p>




<p>The I School proudly carries forward its library school heritage through its alumni, and through an enduring commitment to making information accessible, useful, and relevant.</p>

Foundations of data science from three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis</span><span class="deschide"> of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social and legal issues surrounding data analysis, including issues of privacy and data ownership.</span><br/>

Surveying history through the lens of information and information through the lens of history, this course looks across time to consider what might distinguish ours as &quot;the information age&quot; and what that description implies about the role of &quot;information technology&quot; across time.

In every instance, we'll be concerned with what and when, but also with how and why.

This course introduces students to natural language processing and exposes them to the variety of methods available for reasoning about text in computational systems. NLP is deeply interdisciplinary, drawing on both linguistics and computer science, and helps drive much contemporary work in text analysis (as used in computational social science, the digital humanities, and computational journalism). We will focus on major algorithms used</span><span class="deschide"> in NLP for various applications (part-of-speech tagging, parsing, coreference resolution, machine translation) and on the linguistic phenomena those algorithms attempt to model. Students will implement algorithms and create linguistically annotated data on which those algorithms depend.</span><br/>

This course is a graduate-level introduction to HCI research. Students will learn to conduct<br/>
original HCI research by reading and discussing research papers while collaborating on a<br/>
semester-long research project. Each week the class will focus on a theme of HCI research and<br/>
review foundational and cutting-edge research relevant to that theme. The class will focus on the<br/>
following areas of HCI research: ubiquitous computing, social computing</span><span class="deschide">, critical theory, and<br/>
human-AI interaction. In addition to these research topics the class will introduce common<br/>
qualitative and quantitative methodologies in HCI research.</span><br/>

As it's generally used, &quot;information&quot; is a collection of notions, rather than a single coherent concept. In this course, we'll examine conceptions of information based in information theory, philosophy, social science, economics, and history. Issues include: How compatible are these conceptions; can we talk about &quot;information&quot; in the abstract? What work do these various notions play in discussions of literacy, intellectual</span><span class="deschide"> property, advertising, and the political process? And where does this leave &quot;information studies&quot; and &quot;the information society&quot;?</span><br/>

&quot;Behavioral Economics&quot; is one important perspective on how information impacts human behavior. The goal of this class is to deploy a few important theories about the relationship between information and behavior, into practical settings — emphasizing the design of experiments that can now be incorporated into many 'applications' in day-to-day life. Truly 'smart systems' will have built into them precise, testable propositions about</span><span class="deschide"> how human behavior can be modified by what the systems tell us and do for us. So let's design these experiments into our systems from the ground up! This class develops a theoretically informed, practical point of view on how to do that more effectively and with greater impact.<br/></span><br/>

This course introduces students to natural language processing and exposes them to the variety of methods available for reasoning about text in computational systems. NLP is deeply interdisciplinary, drawing on both linguistics and computer science, and helps drive much contemporary work in text analysis (as used in computational social science, the digital humanities, and computational journalism). We will focus on major algorithms used</span><span class="deschide"> in NLP for various applications (part-of-speech tagging, parsing, coreference resolution, machine translation) and on the linguistic phenomena those algorithms attempt to model.

An intensive weekly discussion of current and ongoing research by Ph.D. students with a research interest in issues of information (social, legal, technical, theoretical, etc.).
